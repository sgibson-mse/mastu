"""
This script demonstrates how to calculate the volumetric sensitivity
matrix for the bolometer foils. For low resolution grids (~1k cells,
~10k rays), the calculation is fast enough to be performed in an
interactive session.  For higher resolution grids (~1M cells) or higher
ray counts (~1M rays) this should be submitted as a batch job
instead. See the `core_highres.sh` script for an example.

Note that the noise in the sensitivity matrix varies inversely with both
the size of the grid cells and the number of rays. So smaller cells will
require higher ray counts (to get sufficient rays to pass through each
cell).
